First, load the bitstream onto the FPGA.

Start by testing Serial In, Parallel Out:
Set Switch 0 to high to enable the clock.
Then, bring Switch 1 to high to toggle the shift register for the serial input - toggle it once for each bit and watch the bits load in LSB.
Then, to parallel read, press button 0 to ensure that all of the bits light up based on the intended value (in our sample code, this 0xA5).
To confirm that this operation is clock-independent, try switching the clock pin to low and confirming the behavior holds.

Then, test Parallel In:
Press Button 0 to toggle the parallel read feature and ensure that this overrides the serial input as we intended.
To confirm that this operation is clock-independent, try switching the clock pin to low and confirming the behavior holds.
